# Connectography

The roadmap of this book follws several interconnected thrusts.

1. connectivity has replaced division as the new paradigm of global organization
2. devolution is the most powerful political force of our age: everywhere empires are splintering and authority is dissipating away from central capitals toward provinces and cities that eek autonomy in their financial and diplomatic affairs.
3. the nature of geopolitical competition is evolving from war over territory to war over connectivity.

Mapping the complext dynamics among the three greatest forces shaping our planet -- man, nature, and technology -- will require a whole new kind of geographic literacy.

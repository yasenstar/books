..."enterprise IT" used to stand for a set of systems that transacted and recorded business operations -- what we call "systems of record." These were designed around departmental processes, organized around databases, enabled by online transaction processing, and understood through business intelligence reporting and analystics.

Questions from IT professionals that feeling they're ignored:

- How do we know what to build when we have no insight into business planning?
- How to we keep executives' attention long enough to get their support - and funding?
- How do we find an executive sponsor for our projects?
- How do we effectively prioritize key initiatives and not alienate remaining stakeholders?
- Our vendors say they can help us deliver. What should they own relative to what we own?
- What does innovation look like in a corporate culture that's deadline driven?
- What should I outsource?
- What should I surrender?

While business was feeling overwhelmed:

- How do I know if IT is on the right track?
- How do I enlist the CIO's help in fulfilling corporate objectives?
- Wouldn't it be easier for each business unit to own its own technologies?
- What do I do when IT says they're too busy?
- IT is telling me I have to provide funding. How much of their development should come out of my budget?
- I'm feeling like the technical staff prioritizes existing technologies over innovative new products. How do I pin the down?
- My CEO is telling me that this project is mission critical. How much personal involvement should I expect to have?
- What should I outsourced?
- What should I surrender?

# Part 1 IT Challenges, Real and Perceived

_Sometimes I get discouraged<br>Sometimes I feel so down<br>Sometime I get so worried<br>But I don't know what about<br>--Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, "Century City" (1979)_

...I'm think of what Tolstoy said about how happy families are all alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. No two IT departments break in exactly the same place.

# Foreword

..."enterprise IT" used to stand for a set of systems that transacted and recorded business operations -- what we call "systems of record." These were designed around departmental processes, organized around databases, enabled by online transaction processing, and understood through business intelligence reporting and analytics.

Questions from IT professionals that feeling they're ignored:

- How do we know what to build when we have no insight into business planning?
- How to we keep executives' attention long enough to get their support - and funding?
- How do we find an executive sponsor for our projects?
- How do we effectively prioritize key initiatives and not alienate remaining stakeholders?
- Our vendors say they can help us deliver. What should they own relative to what we own?
- What does innovation look like in a corporate culture that's deadline driven?
- What should I outsource?
- What should I surrender?

While business was feeling overwhelmed:

- How do I know if IT is on the right track?
- How do I enlist the CIO's help in fulfilling corporate objectives?
- Wouldn't it be easier for each business unit to own its own technologies?
- What do I do when IT says they're too busy?
- IT is telling me I have to provide funding. How much of their development should come out of my budget?
- I'm feeling like the technical staff prioritizes existing technologies over innovative new products. How do I pin the down?
- My CEO is telling me that this project is mission critical. How much personal involvement should I expect to have?
- What should I outsourced?
- What should I surrender?

# Part 1 IT Challenges, Real and Perceived

_Sometimes I get discouraged<br>Sometimes I feel so down<br>Sometime I get so worried<br>But I don't know what about<br>--Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, "Century City" (1979)_

...I'm think of what Tolstoy said about how happy families are all alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. No two IT departments break in exactly the same place.

## 01 What's Wrong with IT?

Common Excuses for IT Status Quo:

| Theme and / or Excuse       | Telltale Signs                                               | Actual Quote from an IT Executive                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Lack of Leadership          | - The CEO doesn't establish clear measures for IT executives.<br />- Key decision makers ignore IT or fail to engage<br />- IT executives are not involved in business planning<br />- Charismatic or visibility-focused CEOs may not view technology as newsworth. | "He keeps saying 'just keep doing what you're doing.' But I'm getting bad performance reviews, and I've been disinvited to the board meetings. I didn't do anything wrong. The question is, Am I doing anything _right_?" |
| Lack of Strategy            | - The CEO or board of directors doesn't clearly communicate corporate direction.<br />- Key initiative owners don't involve IT in planning or budgeting.<br />- There's a general failure to link technology to corporate goals. | "The only way I can figure out where the company is going is by reading our annual report." |
| The need for Modernization  | '- Aging systems require inordinate time and resources to maintain.<br />- Confusion about emerging technologies results in inertia.<br />- Legacy systems have become part of the cultural norm. | "They keep talking about using IT or first-mover advantage. But I'm up to my eyeballs trying to replace our 30-year-old mainframe and our 20-year-old customer information file. There's no time for anything new." |
| Lack of Budget or Headcount |                                                              |                                                              |
|                             |                                                              |                                                              |
|                             |                                                              |                                                              |
|                             |                                                              |                                                              |

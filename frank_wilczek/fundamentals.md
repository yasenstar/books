## Preface: Born Again

_Fundamentals_ is meants to offer an alternative to traditional religious fundamentalism.

Babies are like the scientists, making experiments and drawing conclusions.

To those who are born again, in the way of science, the world comes to seem fresh, lucid, and wonderfully abundant. They come to live out William Blake's vision:

```text
To see a World in a Grain of Sand
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
And Eternity in an hour
```

## Introduction

Newton says about method of _analysis and synthesis_:

```text
As in mathematics, so in natural philosophy the the investigation of difficult things by the method of analysis ought ever to precede the method of composition. This analysis consists of making experiments and observations, and in drawing general conclusions from them by induction....By this way of analysis we may proceed from compounds to ingredients, and from motions to the forces producing them; and in general from effects to their causes, and from particular causes to more general ones till the argument end in the most general. This is the method of analysis: and the synthesis consists in assuming the causes discovered and established as principles, and by them explaining the phenomena preceding form them, and proving the explanations.

## I. WHAT THERE IS

### 1. There's Plenty of Space

Sample: assumptions used for designing and builing Global Positioning System \(GPS\):

* The system relies on the idea that the speed of light is constant.
* It uses atomic clocks, whose design and interpretation relies on advanced principles of quantum theory, to do accurate timing.
* It uses the tools of classical mechanics to calculate the position of the satellites it deploys.
* It makes corrections for the effect, predicted by general relativity, that the rate of clocks depends slightly on their elevation about Earth. Clocks run slower near Earth's surface, where its gravitational field is stronger.

### 2. There's Plenty of Time

Nature is not limited by the speed of human thought. Events can happen much faster than our processing rate of 40 per second, even though our vision can't resolve them.

### 3. There Are Very Few Ingredients

#### Principles: Reality and its Rivals

Four \(Deceptively\) Easy Principles:

1. The Basic Laws Describe Change. _It is useful to separate the description of the world into two parts: states and laws. States describe "what there is," while laws describe "how things change."_
2. The Basic Laws are Universal. _That is, the basic laws hold everywhere, and for all times._
3. The Basic Laws are Local. _That is, the behavior of an object in the immediate future depends only on current conditions in its immediate vicinity. The standard scientific jargon for this principle is locality._
4. The Basic Laws are Precise. _The laws are precise, and they admit no exceptions. Thus, they can be formulated as mathematical equations._

### 4. There Are Very Few Laws

The four forces are:

* electromagnetism, or in its full quantum glory, quantum electromagnetism \(QED\)
* the strong force, or in its full quantum glory, quantum chromodynamics \(QCD\)
* gravity, as captured in Einstein's general relativity
* the weak force

### 5. There's Plenty of Matter and Energy

## II. BEGINNINGS AND ENDS

### 6. Cosmic History Is an Open Book

_Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler. -- Albert Einstein_

The big bang theory of cosmic history uses the naive picture of the early universe as a hot homogeneous \(同质\) gas that I sketched originally, before I raised worries about its stability. The big bang theory simply puts those worries aside. Fundamentally, therefore, the big bang theory is a strange hybrid of two opposing ideas. It postulated complete _equilibrium_ for the non-gravitational interactions, but maximal _disequilibrium_ for gravity.

### 7. Complexity Emerges

### 8. There's Plenty More to See

### 9. Mysteries Remain

### 10. Complementarity Is Mind-Expanding

## Afterward: The Long Voyage Home

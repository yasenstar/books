_What is is that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? -- Stephen Hawking_

# Introduction

_There was so much to grok, so little to grok from. -- Robert A. Heinlein_

The truth, of course, is that all conplex life-forms have built-in, instinctive physics concepts that have been hardwired into their nervous system by evolution. Without this preprogrammed physics software, survival would be impossible. Mutation and natural selection have made us all physicists, even animals. In humans the large size of the brain has allowed there instincts to evolve into concepts that we carry at the conscious level.

...What emerged -- the General Theory of Relativity -- profoundly changed all the traditional ideas about geometry. Space-time became flexible, curved, or warped. It responded to the existence of matter almost like a sheet of rubber under stress. Previously, space-time had been passive, its geometric properties fixed. In the General Theory, space-time became an active player: it could be deformed by massive objects such as planets and stars, but it could not be visualized -- not without a lot of additional mathematics anyway.

...By the early 1950s, Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger, Sin-Itiro Tomanaga, and Freeman Dyson had laid the groundwork for a synthesis of _Special_ Relativity and Quantum Mechanics called __Quantum Field Theory__. But the _General_ Theory of Relativity (Einstein's synthesis of Special Relativity and Newton's theory of gravity) and Quantum Mechanics remained irreconcilable, though not from lack of trying. ...

Today it is widely believed that gravity and Quantum Mechanics will play equally important roles in determining the laws of __elementary particles (基本粒子)__. ... The new wiring, whatever it is, will be called _quantum gravity_, but even without knowing its detailed form, we can safely say that the new paradigm will involve very unfamiliar concepts of space and tie.

# Preface: Born Again

_Fundamentals_ is meants to offer an alternative to traditional religious fundamentalism.

Babies are like the scientists, making experiments and drawing conclusions.

To those who are born again, in the way of science, the world comes to seem fresh, lucid, and wonderfully abundant. They come to live out William Blake's vision:

```
To see a World in a Grain of Sand
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
And Eternity in an hour
```

# Introduction

Newton says about method of _analysis and synthesis_:

```
As in mathematics, so in natural philosophy the the investigation of difficult things by the method of analysis ought ever to precede the method of composition. This analysis consists of making experiments and observations, and in drawing general conclusions from them by induction....By this way of analysis we may proceed from compounds to ingredients, and from motions to the forces producing them; and in general from effects to their causes, and from particular causes to more general ones till the argument end in the most general. This is the method of analysis: and the synthesis consists in assuming the causes discovered and established as principles, and by them explaining the phenomena preceding form them, and proving the explanations.

# I. WHAT THERE IS

## 1. There's Plenty of Space

Sample: assumptions used for designing and builing Global Positioning System (GPS):

- The system relies on the idea that the speed of light is constant.
- It uses atomic clocks, whose design and interpretation relies on advanced principles of quantum theory, to do accurate timing.
- It uses the tools of classical mechanics to calculate the position of the satellites it deploys.
- It makes corrections for the effect, predicted by general relativity, that the rate of clocks depends slightly on their elevation about Earth. Clocks run slower near Earth's surface, where its gravitational field is stronger.

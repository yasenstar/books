Stop Working and Start Leading --

- Great leaders don't work; they facilitate and orchestrate.
- They think of great strategies and help others implement them.
- They spend their time preparing for the future.
- They take a comprehensive view of their terrain while also noticing key details so they can confidently choose the right forks in the road.
- Great leaders don't _do_ anything -- except think, make key decisions, help people do their jobs better, and add a touch of organizational control to make sure the final recipes come out okay.
- In share contrast, most leaders are too busy actually _working_ to do these things -- and their teams suffer as a result.

# Preface

We can't escape our ancestors, however, and the influence that their successes have had on the way we live our lives. In particular, they endowed (赋予) us with a natural inclination to actively pursue our goals -- so much so that __not acting feels terribly wrong__. This legacy is tremendously helpful -- until we become leaders. Then <u>our natural tendencies (倾向) to act</u> lead us to do too much. This is the curve of over-managing, and far too many leaders fall under its spell. _Do Nothing!_ shows you why you much fight this natural tendency, both in your thoughts and in your actions.

Leaders have a tremendous, trickle-down impact on scores of people: one great leader can have a host of positive effects on hundreds, sometimes a thousands of people. Organizations are reflections of their leaders, and if their leaders can be more effective and avoid over-managing, many, many people will benefit.

# 1. Do Nothing!

The KEY insight here is simple: you will be a more effective leader if, rather than doing the work yourself, you let other people do it. In other words, stop working and start leading.

As you move up in the world, people will look to you to think big thoughts and orchestrate the big issues; they will want you to use broad brush-strokes rather than focusing on details -- even if you are really good at being a detail person.

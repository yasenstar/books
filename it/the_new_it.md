## Foreword

..."enterprise IT" used to stand for a set of systems that transacted and recorded business operations -- what we call "systems of record." These were designed around departmental processes, organized around databases, enabled by online transaction processing, and understood through business intelligence reporting and analytics.

Questions from IT professionals that feeling they're ignored:

* How do we know what to build when we have no insight into business planning?
* How to we keep executives' attention long enough to get their support - and funding?
* How do we find an executive sponsor for our projects?
* How do we effectively prioritize key initiatives and not alienate remaining stakeholders?
* Our vendors say they can help us deliver. What should they own relative to what we own?
* What does innovation look like in a corporate culture that's deadline driven?
* What should I outsource?
* What should I surrender?

While business was feeling overwhelmed:

* How do I know if IT is on the right track?
* How do I enlist the CIO's help in fulfilling corporate objectives?
* Wouldn't it be easier for each business unit to own its own technologies?
* What do I do when IT says they're too busy?
* IT is telling me I have to provide funding. How much of their development should come out of my budget?
* I'm feeling like the technical staff prioritizes existing technologies over innovative new products. How do I pin the down?
* My CEO is telling me that this project is mission critical. How much personal involvement should I expect to have?
* What should I outsourced?
* What should I surrender?

## Part 1 IT Challenges, Real and Perceived

_Sometimes I get discouraged_  
_Sometimes I feel so down_  
_Sometime I get so worried_  
_But I don't know what about_  
_--Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, "Century City" \(1979\)_

...I'm think of what Tolstoy said about how happy families are all alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. No two IT departments break in exactly the same place.

### 01 What's Wrong with IT?

#### Common Excuses for IT Status Quo

| Theme and / or Excuse | Telltale Signs | Actual Quote from an IT Executive |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Lack of Leadership | - The CEO doesn't establish clear measures for IT executives. - Key decision makers ignore IT or fail to engage - IT executives are not involved in business planning - Charismatic or visibility-focused CEOs may not view technology as newsworth. | "He keeps saying 'just keep doing what you're doing.' But I'm getting bad performance reviews, and I've been disinvited to the board meetings. I didn't do anything wrong. The question is, Am I doing anything _right_?" |
| Lack of Strategy | - The CEO or board of directors doesn't clearly communicate corporate direction. - Key initiative owners don't involve IT in planning or budgeting. - There's a general failure to link technology to corporate goals. | "The only way I can figure out where the company is going is by reading our annual report." |
| The need for Modernization | '- Aging systems require inordinate time and resources to maintain. - Confusion about emerging technologies results in inertia. - Legacy systems have become part of the cultural norm. | "They keep talking about using IT or first-mover advantage. But I'm up to my eyeballs trying to replace our 30-year-old mainframe and our 20-year-old customer information file. There's no time for anything new." |
| Lack of Budget or Headcount | '- IT budgets get incrementally smaller as lines of business launch their own projects. - New job openings linger due to low salaries or poor company reputation. - Repeated funding request are rejected in favor for non-IT spending. | "The CEO and board keep telling me that IT is a differentiator. But I've had open job reqs for three director-level positions I can't fill because the pay's so low. I have to personally attend design meetings!" |
| Pressure to Preserve the Base | '- Classic revenue sources are protected at the expense of new product ideas. - Fear exists that innovation will lead to cannibalization. - There is unwillingness to sunset outdated or obsolete products. - The increasing threat of disruptive competitors is being ignored. | "Sales for our bestselling products are down. We need to redirect resources to increasing those revenues. It's never the right time to explore new products or services -- or to formalize innovation." |
| Style Differences | '- IT leaders cite personality differences with corporate leadership as a barrier to engagement. - IT's culture doesn't reflect that of the corporation at large. - Visionary CIOs have difficulty refocusing their staffs toward innovation. | "We can't stand her. She likes to hear herself talk in meetings, and she doesn't listen. She doesn't accept suggestions, and she is unavailable for one-on-one discussions. So I just keep quiet. My next company will get my good ideas." |
| Poor Understanding of IT's Value | '- IT leadership reports to the CFO or COO, not to the CEO - Backward-looking corporate boards perceive IT as a shared service. - There is pressure to outsource potentially differentiating technologies. - IT is marginalized as an operating expense. - A strict hire-from-within policy means a dearth of new thinking or fresh perspectives. | "I've been trying to sell the CFO on investing in analytics. Then he tells me to bring system upgrade cost estimates to the next executive staff meeting. I guess that's all I need to know about how we're measured!" |
